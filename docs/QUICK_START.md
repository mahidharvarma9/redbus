## Step 4: Run the Setup Script

### Windows Users:

1. Open File Explorer
2. Navigate to the RedBus folder â†’ `scripts` folder
3. Double-click `python redbus_setup_and_test.py`
4. Press Enter when prompted
5. Wait 2-5 minutes

### Mac/Linux Users:

1. Open Terminal
2. Navigate to project:
```bash
cd /path/to/RedBus/scripts
```
3. Make script executable:
```bash
chmod +x python3 redbus_setup_and_test.py
```
4. Run it:
```bash
./python3 redbus_setup_and_test.py
```
5. Press Enter when prompted
6. Wait 2-5 minutes

## Step 5: Verify It's Working

The script will automatically:
